# Does Hybrid Working Affects Job Satisfaction?

## A research proposal for one of the courses at the University of Antwerp. Some key points:

Covid-19 upended the way of thinking about work. Do we need to try to adapt, or start thinking about the long term? The answer might come through job satisfaction and well-being in this new hybrid environment. This paper reports on the results obtained from LISS panel to investigate the relationship between general job satisfaction and hybrid working on the one hand, as well as focusing on separate aspects of job satisfaction, such as promotion satisfaction, satisfied atmosphere among colleagues and satisfaction with working hours. Using Covid as an IV, I point out that general job satisfaction is positive and significant for those who working from home, and this significance exists even when controlling on all the characteristics. Promotion’s satisfaction tends to be the highest and most significant compared to satisfaction among colleagues and satisfaction with working hours. Hybrid working is correlated to 37 percentage points increase in the probability to promotions’ satisfaction, while satisfaction among colleagues tend to be negative and significant for a hybrid worker. Working hours satisfaction has no significant impact on a hybrid worker, but it became negative and highly significant for women.
